# Split CI into per-path jobs so a change pays only for what it touches

`bean:0029` was right and made this worse. Wiring `backoffice/` and `e2e/` into
`qualityCheck` closed a real hole — a TypeScript error merged green before it — but it also
means **every Kotlin-only change now runs `npm ci`, `tsc`, ESLint and Prettier**, and every
change of any kind runs Playwright.

Measured on this repository's own history:

| | duration |
|---|---|
| `main`, Kotlin only, before `bean:0029` | ~50–53s |
| after wiring, with npm and Playwright | 2m02s |

That is the cost `bean:0039` is really about, and it is a **CI topology** problem rather
than a repository-boundary problem. Fixing it here is cheap and answers whether the
separation wanted is about gates or about repositories — which is the question `bean:0039`
cannot answer until someone tries the cheap thing.

## Success criteria

- Separate jobs with `paths` filters: a Kotlin change does not run the backoffice checks, a
  backoffice change does not run the Kotlin suites, and a change touching both runs both.
- **Branch protection still passes when a job is skipped.** This is the part that goes wrong:
  a required check that is skipped rather than passed blocks the merge forever. Either the
  required check is an aggregating job that succeeds when its dependencies are skipped, or
  the ruleset names something that always runs. Verify against the `main-protected` ruleset
  on a real pull request, not by reading the workflow.
- `doc:00-constitution` §7.2.4's promise still holds: a green local `qualityCheck` means a
  green CI run. If CI runs a subset per path, the local command must remain the superset, so
  the promise becomes "green locally implies green in CI" and not the reverse. State the
  asymmetry in §7.2.4 rather than letting it become a second silent divergence.
- Measure and record the result. The claim is that this recovers most of the time a split
  would; if it does not, that is `bean:0039`'s answer.
