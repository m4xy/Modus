# A plant script's revert step destroys uncommitted edits to tracked beans, and the convention is written nowhere

`doc:00-constitution#observed-failing` requires a gate be observed rejecting a planted
violation, and the procedure is plant, observe, revert. In this repository the plant is
almost always a bean and the revert step is `git checkout -- .beans`.

That command does not only revert the plant. It reverts **every uncommitted modification to
a tracked file under that path**, including the edits the plant exists to prove. Nothing in
`AGENTS.md`, `doc:80-agent-operating-procedure` or `doc:00-constitution` says so.

## Observed

```
cmd:      modify a tracked bean in the working tree, create an untracked file beside it,
          run `git checkout -- .beans`
observed: before:
            tracked edit present:   1
            untracked file present: 1
            git status --porcelain -- .beans:
               M .beans/modus-0033--baseline-writer-erases-regression-provenance.md
              ?? .beans/zz-untracked-probe.md
          after `git checkout -- .beans`:
            tracked edit present:   0
            untracked file present: 1
exit:     0
```

**The boundary is tracked versus untracked, and it is exactly the wrong way round for this
sprint's workflow.**

| what the branch is doing | files involved | survives a plant? |
|---|---|---|
| raising a new bean, before its first commit | untracked | **yes** |
| closing beans — flipping `status:` on merged beans | tracked, modified | **no** |
| appending an `## Amendments` entry | tracked, modified | **no** |
| correcting a bean under review | tracked, modified | **no** |
| editing `tools/` or `documentation/` beside a bean plant | tracked, modified | **no**, when the revert step names those paths too |

So the one shape that is safe is a bean nobody has committed yet, and every shape that
carries this sprint's actual work is destroyed. The loss is silent: the plant's own output is
unaffected and looks correct, because the plant ran against the file it planted.

### The instance

Recorded because `doc:00-constitution#evidence-rule` applies to a claim about work as much as
to a claim about code. While applying a review round to `.beans/modus-0087`, a plant script
ending in `git checkout -- .beans` was run against the same tree. Every correction in that
round — a corpus re-measurement, a reversed blast-radius section, a rewritten criteria row
and a `blocked_by` edge — was reverted in one step. The plant printed what it was expected to
print. The loss was found only by re-reading the file afterwards, and the round was redone
from scratch.

## Why it belongs in `AGENTS.md` rather than in a document

`AGENTS.md`'s Commands block already carries two conventions of exactly this class: the stale
`GITHUB_TOKEN` credential trap, and the sandbox's refusal of certain command shapes. Both are
working conventions that cost an agent real work when unknown and are only ever discovered by
being bitten. Both were added by `bean:0058`.

`AGENTS.md` states that it never restates a rule. The line added here states a **convention**
and cites `doc:00-constitution#observed-failing` rather than restating it, which is the same
form as the two beside it.

## Why this bean exists at all

The change shipped once without a bean, on the reasoning that `bean:0058` owns unwritten
working conventions but is `completed`, so `docs-lint` check 11 makes it append-only and
`adr:0005-evidence-lives-in-the-work-item#amendments` would require `**Claimed:**`,
`**Found:**` and `**Evidence:**` lines. That half is sound and is verified: this is an
**addition**, not a correction, so there is no original claim for those lines to carry, and
forcing them would produce a malformed amendment written to satisfy a shape — which
`.beans/modus-0087` argues is itself worth refusing.

The half that failed was the jump from "`bean:0058` cannot take it" to "no bean at all",
which never considered raising a new one. `doc:00-constitution` §7.2 step 1 admits no
exception: every branch has exactly one work item, and if none exists it is created before
the branch. The precedent runs the same way — the pull request that added the first two
conventions to this same block carried `bean:0058`.

**"Directed by the orchestrator" is not a waiver.** `doc:00-constitution#independent-review`
gives the orchestrator merge authority, not authority over §7.2 step 1. The instruction to
raise a bean *only if the line would not fit the budget* treated the requirement as a
fallback for a space problem. It is not one, and following it was still the author's error to
catch.

## Success criteria

| # | criterion | evidence kind |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AGENTS.md` carries the convention in its Commands block, beside the two of the same class, within the 120-line budget check 8 enforces | diff |
| 2 | The wording distinguishes tracked from untracked, because the distinction decides whether an agent's current work is at risk | diff |
| 3 | The tracked/untracked boundary is observed rather than asserted | test-run |
| 4 | `bash tools/docs-lint.sh` green, check 8 included | test-run |

## Not in scope

- The plant-and-revert procedure itself (`doc:00-constitution#observed-failing`). The
  procedure is correct; what is missing is a warning about how it is usually implemented.
- Changing any plant script in `tools/`. The scripts that carry this hazard are scratch
  files outside the repository.
- `bean:0058`, which is `completed` and frozen, and which this bean deliberately does not
  amend.
- A mechanical check for the hazard. Nothing here can see a scratch script.
